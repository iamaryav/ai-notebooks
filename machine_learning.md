# Machine Learning

Types:
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised
#### Regression 
- Predicts the number from infinitely many possible numbers
- Ex - prediction housing prices

#### Classification
- Less number of outputs
- seperates data in diff category/class
- It predicts categories
- Boundary line seperates between two groups
- Ex - Cancer groups

### Unsupervised 
#### Clustering
- No output labels
- Find something interesting in unlabeled data
- Ex - Google News
#### Anomaly Detection
#### Dimensionality Reduction
